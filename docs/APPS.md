# Apps #

Your site is made of `apps`, which are in the apps folder. Every app that
defines routes is accessible in your site. The "admin" app is mounted at
"/admin" and the "auth" app is mounted at "/auth".

Any apps that you add will be mounted at their name.

The special site app (which is in the `site/` dir) is mounted at "/".
