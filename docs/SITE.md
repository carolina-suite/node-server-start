# The Site App #

The site app contains files that pertain to the site as a whole as well
as being the app that is mounted at root ("/").

The file `home.js` defines your home route. Currently it is just serving
the file `site/templates/home.pug`. You should make that template your
landing page, and perhaps redirect users to another place.
